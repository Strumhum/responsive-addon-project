          <h5>Why</h5>
          <h3>Why is Ted Lasso my favourite TV series?</h3>
          <p>
            Jason Sudeikis is Ted Lasso, a football coach hired to manage a
            British soccer team. What he lacks in knowledge, he makes up for
            with optimism, determination...and biscuits.
          </p>
          <p class="last-p">
            What makes Ted Lasso so successful, popular and fun to watch is its
            'feel-good' atmosphere. The series just makes you feel better, it
            uplifts you and it certainly makes you look at everything in a more
            positive and optimistic way. Joyful and funny moments are delicately
            balanced against heavier emotional storylines. You fall in love with
            the cast of wonderful characters and the unbridled empathetic
            coaching style of Lasso. I BELIEVE in Ted Lasso!

            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p>
              Hi! My name is Sue and I live in London. I love the TV series Ted
              Lasso. It was such an optimistic lifeline for many throughout the
              pandemic. I created this page as part of the SheCodes MAX course
              to develop my coding skills, and because like Ted, I BELIEVE!
