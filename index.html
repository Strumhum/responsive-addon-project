          <h5>Why</h5>
          <h3>Why is Ted Lasso my favourite TV series?</h3>
          <p>
            Jason Sudeikis is Ted Lasso, a football coach hired to manage a
            British soccer team. What he lacks in knowledge, he makes up for
            with optimism, determination...and biscuits.
          </p>
          <p class="last-p">
            What makes Ted Lasso so successful, popular and fun to watch is its
            'feel-good' atmosphere. The series just makes you feel better, it
            uplifts you and it certainly makes you look at everything in a more
            positive and optimistic way. Joyful and funny moments are delicately
            balanced against heavier emotional storylines. You fall in love with
            the cast of wonderful characters and the unbridled empathetic
            coaching style of Lasso. I BELIEVE in Ted Lasso!

              <h6>Season 1</h6>
              <p>
                Ted Lasso, an American college football coach, is unexpectedly
                recruited to coach a fictional English Premier League soccer
                team, AFC Richmond, despite having no previous experience
                coaching soccer. The team's owner, Rebecca Welton, hires Lasso
                hoping he will fail as a means of exacting revenge on the team's
                previous owner, her unfaithful ex-husband. However, Ted's charm,
                personality, and humour begin to win over Rebecca, the team, and
                those who had been sceptical about his appointment.

              <p>
                Coach Ted Lasso has seen the Greyhounds work their way back up
                to the Premier League. The club hire a psychologist called
                Sharon. Rebecca’s father dies, and the funeral stirs up
                complicated emotions for many, including Jamie Tartt and Roy
                Kent. Poor Keeley Jones has to deal with a blip in the love
                triangle as a result. And Nathan Shelley, the kit man turned
                assistant coach, has left on bad terms to coach West Ham United
                under Rupert Mannion, former owner of AFC Richmond and dastardly
                ex-husband of Rebecca.

              Hi! My name is Sue and I live in London. I love the TV series Ted

              pandemic. I created this page as part of the SheCodes MAX course
              to develop my coding skills, and because like Ted, I BELIEVE!
